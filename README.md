"Project Merge Defense" is a prototype for a tower defense game on Android that I created <b>between my 2. and 3. Semester</b> at the [S4G School for games](https://www.school4games.net/).
My goal with this project was to learn more about tool programming, aswell as creating the foundation for a fun tower defense/merge hybrid to potentially return working on in the future.

# Gameplay

The main premise of this Tower Defense game is that you can only buy random turrets and upgrade them by merging two of the same kind and level together. Carefully managing your limited tiles where you can build and merge your turrets is key to victory.

# How to run
For legal reasons this is a code-only version that won't compile on its own. But feel free to play the latest build of the prototype [here](https://suchti0352.itch.io/project-merge-defense) using your Browser.

# Highlight: Levelbuilder

Levels were crafted within the [custom Levelbuilder Window](https://github.com/BasKrueger/MergeDefense/tree/main/Scripts/LevelBuilder/PathBuilder).

Features include:

- easy and save way to build level layouts.
- simple way to design enemy waves. Including the spawn duration duration, aswell as when which enemy type gets spawned and more.
- create, save and load levels as simple scriptable objects.
